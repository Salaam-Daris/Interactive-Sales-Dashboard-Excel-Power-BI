# Interactive-Sales-Dashboard-Excel-Power-BI
#📝 Overview

This project analyzes sales data to understand overall business performance across product categories, states, customers, and time periods. The dashboard presents key sales and profit metrics in a clear and interactive format, helping users quickly identify trends, patterns, and performance insights.

#❓ Problem Statement

Sales data was available in raw format, making it difficult to track profit trends, identify top-performing categories, analyze regional performance, and understand customer contribution. There was no single dashboard to view and monitor sales performance effectively.

#💡 Solution

An interactive sales dashboard was built using Excel and Power BI to visualize profit over time, sales by category, state-wise sales performance, customer count by year, monthly sales trends, and top profit-generating customers. Filters for year and category allow users to drill down and analyze data easily.
