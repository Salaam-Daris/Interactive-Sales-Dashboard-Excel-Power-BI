# Interactive-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Microsoft-Excel

## 📝 Overview

This project analyzes sales data to understand overall business performance across product categories, states, customers, and time periods. The dashboard presents key sales and profit metrics in a clear and interactive format, helping users quickly identify trends, patterns, and performance insights.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Sales data was available in raw format, making it difficult to track profit trends, identify top-performing categories, analyze regional performance, and understand customer contribution. There was no single dashboard to view and monitor sales performance effectively.

## 💡 Solution

An interactive sales dashboard was built using Excel to visualize profit over time, sales by category, state-wise sales performance, customer count by year, monthly sales trends, and top profit-generating customers. Filters for year and category allow users to drill down and analyze data easily.

## 📈 Business Value

• Enables management to track sales and profit performance across multiple years

• Identifies top-performing product categories and high-value customers

• Provides clear visibility into state-wise sales performance

• Helps understand monthly sales trends and seasonality

• Supports faster and better data-driven business decisions

## 🛠️ Tools Used

**Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and dashboard creation

**SQL** – Basic querying for data extraction and validation (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY)

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to work with sales data, build meaningful dashboards, and present insights in a simple and business-friendly manner.
